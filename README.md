# SUPERSUPERMAX
Unity Game developed for a course in University, and then updated to include UI buttons so that devices with touch controls can interact with it (phones, tablets and Windows Touch Displays).

I am aware a tutorial would be nice to have and that the first vehicle (the van) is quite bad to drive. This is a proof of concept and the game progression needs polishing.
To quickly earn money I recommend the pursuit mode.


WebGL Build: (*Recommended only for keyboard, although it works with touch controls the web version has some bugs the .apk Android version does not.*)
